Add types to doc_val_varspec.json
to give an example of how to run
this program to update documentation.

Define return syntax:
    Perhaps add 
    '# rets {X}'
    above the function definition line,
    then {X} is defined by having variable
    names, separated by ORs; also possible
    to have tuple<var, var, var>, or
    tuple<var OR var, var>. Need to make
    decision on how it works.
