The most important user supplied document in this
module is the 'varspec.json' file - a file which
explains the info for every variable that is
used as an argument for any function. It
is important that each of the components in
the varspec.json "types" key has the key
"name", "subtype", and "desc". Those are 
all used to create docstrings among other
things, like verifying a config dict.
If it is a dict, it must have one of the
following keys: 'dict_keys', 'dict_spec',
or 'unknown'. 
'dict_keys' is a dict
with the keys in the variable (which
is a dict) and they map to the name 
of the variable type to which the
key in the actual object points to.
'dict_spec' is a dict
with only a single key and single value,
in which the single key represents all
the possible keys in this dict, for example
this could be a dict in which each key is
a barcode of length 20, so the barcode of
length 20 should be defined as its own variable
with restrictions, and then what it points
to is again an object that is defined earlier
in the variable specification.
'unknown' means this dict is variable and
it's better not to list what is inside it.
